### Hey, I'm Asad 👋  
**Full Stack Developer | MERN & React Native | Passionate about building cool stuff**

I’m a full-stack developer based in Pakistan. I love working on impactful, clean, and functional web/mobile apps — mostly with React, React Native, Node.js, and sometimes Django. I enjoy solving real-world problems and turning ideas into actual products. My work ranges from full-stack social platforms to workout trackers and Electron apps.
